- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
A lot of equivalent methods/syntax to those in Python although there are too many to get used to at once.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
I think programming in Java requires me to be so much more detailed and meticulous because everything has to be declared and Java follows my code in a very rigid manner. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I have got the basic functions to work but the conversation is still not perfect in terms of grammar and context. I've modified my work to make it more object-oriented and less procedural although it does not seem so at the moment.
